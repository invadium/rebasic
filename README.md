# ReBasic Interpreter Core

ReBasic VM and core libraries.

It can run in a console mode,
but mostly usable within a browser shell.

Check out [rebasic.mix](https://github.com/invider/rebasic.mix)
for the web shell project and documentation.

ReBasic can run most of the examples from old BASIC books.
The difference is only in I/O operations, drawing
and all the PEEK and POKE magic you can find in the VIC20/C64 dialects.
